Description: This package contains functions that help with data wrangling, modeling, and visualization. This package was designed to simplify coral restoration and monitoring data and summarize it, run multiple t-tests, and to visualize the data using box and scatter plots. The goal of the creation of this package was to learn how to create a package consisting of functions and R skills that we learned in the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa MBIO 612 course.
